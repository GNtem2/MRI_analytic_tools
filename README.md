# MRI analytic tools  
Tools for everyone!  
Also check my code for some nice [R plots](https://github.com/rcruces/R-graph).

# [Vector Correction for DWI data](https://github.com/rcruces/MRI_analytic_tools/tree/master/vector_corr) 
**`vector_corr`** is a handy script to undestand the steps for correcting the diffusion vectors (bvecs) when the adquisition matrix is angled.    
This requires and updated version or **[mrtrix](http://www.mrtrix.org/)**, the transformation matrix from the adquisition of the DWI (omat), bvecs and bvals in column format, and the text file of corrected.eddy parameters obtained after topup/eddy from FSL.  
- Check the code in the directory [/vector_corr](https://github.com/rcruces/MRI_analytic_tools/tree/master/vector_corr)

# [FreeSurfer Preprocessing](https://github.com/rcruces/MRI_analytic_tools/tree/master/Freesurfer_preprocessing)  
A practical guideline for preprocessing T1 weighted images with FreeSurfer. For further information and detailles check the official webpage [here](https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/).  
- This guideline requires the previous installation of [Advance Normalization Tools](https://stnava.github.io/ANTs/) (ANTs), [FreeSurfer](https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/DownloadAndInstall), and [minc-toolkit](https://github.com/BIC-MNI/minc-toolkit).  
- You can find the tutorial in [/Freesurfer_preprocessing](https://github.com/rcruces/MRI_analytic_tools/tree/master/Freesurfer_preprocessing).
  
# [Connectome Prediction Modeling CPM](https://github.com/rcruces/MRI_analytic_tools/tree/master/R_connectome_prediction_modelling)
This is the **R implementation** (originally in matlab) of a connectome-based predictive modeling to predict individual behavior from brain connectivity as described by [Shen et al.](https://www.nature.com/articles/nprot.2016.178).  
The original code in matlab can be found in this [link](https://www.nitrc.org/frs/?group_id=51).  
I used this method with real structural data and a behavioral variable without succes, so included an ideal example of how this method would work if you have a strong linear relations between the connectomes *W<sub>ij</sub>* and a cognitive feature.  
- All data an a matlab script for validation of the R implementation can be found here: [/R_connectome_prediction_modelling](https://github.com/rcruces/MRI_analytic_tools/tree/master/R_connectome_prediction_modelling)
